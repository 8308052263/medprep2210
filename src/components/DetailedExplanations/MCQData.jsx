    question: "Which drug is considered the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis?",
    options: [
      "Diphenhydramine",
      "Hydrocortisone",
      "Epinephrine",
      "Salbutamol"
    ],
    answer: "Epinephrine",
    explanation: "Epinephrine is the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis. It acts quickly by stimulating alpha and beta-adrenergic receptors to reduce airway swelling, increase blood pressure, and reverse bronchospasm."

    topic: "Physiology",
    question: "Which part of the nephron is primarily responsible for glucose reabsorption?",
    options: [
      "Loop of Henle",
      "Proximal convoluted tubule",
      "Distal convoluted tubule",
      "Collecting duct"
    ],
    answer: "Proximal convoluted tubule",
    explanation: "Glucose reabsorption in the nephron primarily occurs in the proximal convoluted tubule via sodium-glucose transport proteins (SGLT)."

    question: "What is the most common type of renal stone?",
    options: [
      "Struvite stone",
      "Uric acid stone",
      "Calcium oxalate stone",
      "Cystine stone"
    ],
    answer: "Calcium oxalate stone",
    explanation: "Calcium oxalate stones are the most common type of kidney stones. They form due to increased urinary calcium and oxalate levels and are often radio-opaque on X-ray."

    question: "Which bacteria is known to cause rice-water stools?",
    options: [
      "Salmonella typhi",
      "Escherichia coli",
      "Vibrio cholerae",
      "Shigella dysenteriae"
    ],
    answer: "Vibrio cholerae",
    explanation: "Vibrio cholerae causes cholera, which is characterized by profuse watery diarrhea described as 'rice-water stools'. The bacteria produce cholera toxin which leads to massive fluid loss."

    topic: "Biochemistry",
    question: "Which vitamin is required for the carboxylation of clotting factors?",
    options: [
      "Vitamin A",
      "Vitamin C",
      "Vitamin D",
      "Vitamin K"
    ],
    answer: "Vitamin K",
    explanation: "Vitamin K is essential for the gamma-carboxylation of glutamic acid residues on clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X. This modification is necessary for calcium binding and activation of these proteins."
